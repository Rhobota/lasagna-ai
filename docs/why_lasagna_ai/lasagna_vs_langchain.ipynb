    "\n",
    "Lasagna AI feels like it was designed by someone who built production AI systems and got frustrated with the chaos, then decided to build something with better architectural principles. It trades ecosystem size for architectural cleanliness.\n",
    "\n",

    "**The choice often comes down to this:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose **Lasagna AI** for production systems where you value predictability, type safety, and clean composition\n",
    "- Choose **LangChain** for rapid prototyping, extensive integrations, and when you need the broader ecosystem\n",
