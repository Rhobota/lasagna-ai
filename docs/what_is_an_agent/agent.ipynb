    "### What is _Agency_?\n",

    "### What is an _AI Agent_?\n",
    "\n",
    "The phrase \"AI Agent\" has risen in popularity since ~2024. Typically, when people use this phrase, they mean a piece of software that uses a Large Language Model (LLM\\*) and has some _tool calling_ capability so that it can _affect_ the world (e.g. send emails, query for today's news, organize your calendar, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is consistent with the idea of _agency_ from above. An LLM, on its own, has no _agency_ (it just spits tokens at you). If you connect that _same_ LLM to software functions (via _tool calling_), then suddenly the LLM gains the ability to _act_, and people start calling it \"agentic\"."
