    """
    Attempt to load known providers at runtime, only when we *actually* need
    them.

    As the name implies, this is just an **attempt**.

    The `provider` string will be one of:
     1. known and loadable ✅, or...
     2. known but not loadable (probably due to a missing dependency) 😥, or...
     3. completely unknown 😥.

    Note: Normally I'd be sad by imports inside functions, but this is
          an acceptable use-case for doing so. We do *not* want to
          force people to install dependencies they don't need, thus
          we have to do some dynamic/runtime import-only-when-you-need-it
          behavior, which is what this function's job is. Moreover, that
          ugly behavior is restricted to *just this function* to keep the
          ugliness to a minimum.
